	abstract = {Typical security contests focus on breaking or mitigating the impact of buggy systems. We present the Build-it Break-it Fix-it {BIBIFI} contest which aims to assess the ability to securely build software not just break it. In {BIBIFI} teams build specified software with the goal of maximizing correctness performance and security. The latter is tested when teams attempt to break other teams submissions. Winners are chosen from among the best builders and the best breakers. {BIBIFI} was designed to be open-ended - teams can use any language tool process etc. that they like. As such contest outcomes shed light on factors that correlate with successfully building secure software and breaking insecure software. During we ran three contests involving a total of teams and two different programming problems. Quantitative analysis from these contests found that the most efficient build-it submissions used {CC} but submissions coded in a statically-typed language were less likely to have a security flaw build-it teams with diverse programming-language knowledge also produced more secure code. Shorter programs correlated with better scores. Break-it teams that were also build-it teams were significantly better at finding security bugs.},

	abstract = {The 2001 U.S. Supreme Court Case of Falvo v. Owasso School System (Owasso Independent School District No I-011 v. Falvo) has focused national attention on the common classroom practice of peer-grading. In a unanimous decision the court reaffirmed the popular view that students grading each others' tests is valuable, saving teachers' time and augmenting student learning. Our study puts these presumed benefits to the test in 4 middle school science classrooms. We compared teacher-assigned grades to those awarded either by students to themselves or by their peers. By training students to grade with the help of a scoring rubric, a very high correlation was obtained between students and their teacher on test questions (r = 0.91 to 0.94). We found patterns of bias when students assigned grades. When grading others, students awarded lower grades to the best performing students than their teacher did. When grading themselves, lower performing students tended to inflate their own low scores. Performance on an unannounced, 2nd administration of the same test 1 week later measured the degree to which student-grading resulted in any increased understanding. Students who graded their peers' tests did not gain significantly more than a control group of students who did not correct any papers but simply took the same test again. Those students who corrected their own tests improved dramatically. Self-grading and peer-grading appear to be reasonable aids to saving teachers' time. Self-grading appears to result in increased student learning; peer-grading does not.},

Test-Driven Development ({TDD}) has gained popularity in computing education, but evaluating students' adherence to {TDD} requires analyzing their development processes instead of only their final product. Consequently, we designed an adaptive feedback system for reinforcing incremental testing behaviors. In this paper, we compare the results of the system with different reinforcement schedules and with- or without- visually salient testing goals. We analyzed snapshots of students' programming projects gathered during development and interviewed students at the end of the academic term. From our findings, we identify potential for influencing student development behaviors and suggest future direction for designing adaptive reinforcement.},

Using Ask-Elle students receive feedback about whether or not they are on the right track, they can ask for a hint when they are stuck, and get suggestions about how to refactor their program. Our tutor generates this feedback from model solutions and properties that a solution should satisfy. This paper studies the feasibility of using model solutions together with the desired properties of solutions to analyse the work of a student. It describes an experiment in which we analyse almost 3500 log entries from students using Ask-Elle to solve functional programming exercises, to determine how many of these programs are diagnosed correctly based on model solutions and the desired properties of solutions. Ask-Elle manages to correctly diagnose 82.9\% of the student programs. A further analysis of the student programs and the diagnoses shows that adding some reasonable model solutions, properties of model solutions, and general program transformations would increase this percentage to 92.9\%.},

	abstract = {Automated assessment systems have been employed in computer science ({CS}) courses at a number of different universities. Such systems are especially applicable in teaching algorithmic problem solving since they can automatically test if an algorithm has been correctly implemented, i.e., that it performs its specified function on a set of inputs. Being able to implement algorithms that work correctly is a crucial skill for {CS} students in their professional role, but it can be difficult to convey the importance of this in a classroom situation. Programming and problem solving education supported by automated grading has been used since 2002 at our department. We study, using action research methodology, different strategies for deploying automated assessment systems in {CS} courses. Towards this end, we have developed an automated assessment system and both introduced it into existing courses and constructed new courses structured around it. Our primary data sources for evaluation consists of course evaluations, statistics on students' submitted solutions, and experience teaching the courses. Authors of this paper have been participating in teaching all of the courses mentioned here.},

It highlights the limitations identified in the thirteen years of Ceilidh's use at the University of Nottingham. It also illustrates how most of these limitations have been resolved by re-designing Ceilidh's architecture and improving various aspects of the marking and administrating processes. The new system, entitled {CourseMarker}, offers enhanced functionality by adding useful features that have long been needed by Ceilidh's community. The paper concludes with an evaluation of the changes and a brief report on the experience of {CourseMarker}'s use over the last three years. Finally, recent developments and future directions are discussed.},

Products to be assessed can include writing, oral presentations, portfolios, test performance, or other skilled behaviors. Peer assessment can be summative or formative. A formative view is presented here, in which the intent is to help students help each other plan their learning, identify their strengths and weaknesses, target areas for remedial action, and develop metacognitive and other personal and professional skills. Peer feedback is available in greater volume and with greater immediacy than teacher feedback. A peer assessor with less skill at assessment but more time in which to do it can produce an assessment of equal reliability and validity to that of a teacher. This article describes effective approaches to peer assessment and encourages teachers to incorporate it into their practice.},
