	abstract = {Typical security contests focus on breaking or mitigating the impact of buggy systems. We present the Build-it Break-it Fix-it BIBIFI contest which aims to assess the ability to securely build software not just break it. In BIBIFI teams build specified software with the goal of maximizing correctness performance and security. The latter is tested when teams attempt to break other teams submissions. Winners are chosen from among the best builders and the best breakers. BIBIFI was designed to be open-ended - teams can use any language tool process etc. that they like. As such contest outcomes shed light on factors that correlate with successfully building secure software and breaking insecure software. During we ran three contests involving a total of teams and two different programming problems. Quantitative analysis from these contests found that the most efficient build-it submissions used CC but submissions coded in a statically-typed language were less likely to have a security flaw build-it teams with diverse programming-language knowledge also produced more secure code. Shorter programs correlated with better scores. Break-it teams that were also build-it teams were significantly better at finding security bugs.},

	abstract = {The 2001 U.S. Supreme Court Case of Falvo v. Owasso School System (Owasso Independent School District No I-011 v. Falvo) has focused national attention on the common classroom practice of peer-grading. In a unanimous decision the court reaffirmed the popular view that students grading each others' tests is valuable, saving teachers' time and augmenting student learning. Our study puts these presumed benefits to the test in 4 middle school science classrooms. We compared teacher-assigned grades to those awarded either by students to themselves or by their peers. By training students to grade with the help of a scoring rubric, a very high correlation was obtained between students and their teacher on test questions (r = 0.91 to 0.94). We found patterns of bias when students assigned grades. When grading others, students awarded lower grades to the best performing students than their teacher did. When grading themselves, lower performing students tended to inflate their own low scores. Performance on an unannounced, 2nd administration of the same test 1 week later measured the degree to which student-grading resulted in any increased understanding. Students who graded their peers' tests did not gain significantly more than a control group of students who did not correct any papers but simply took the same test again. Those students who corrected their own tests improved dramatically. Self-grading and peer-grading appear to be reasonable aids to saving teachers' time. Self-grading appears to result in increased student learning; peer-grading does not.},

Test-Driven Development (TDD) has gained popularity in computing education, but evaluating students' adherence to TDD requires analyzing their development processes instead of only their final product. Consequently, we designed an adaptive feedback system for reinforcing incremental testing behaviors. In this paper, we compare the results of the system with different reinforcement schedules and with- or without- visually salient testing goals. We analyzed snapshots of students' programming projects gathered during development and interviewed students at the end of the academic term. From our findings, we identify potential for influencing student development behaviors and suggest future direction for designing adaptive reinforcement.},

Using Ask-Elle students receive feedback about whether or not they are on the right track, they can ask for a hint when they are stuck, and get suggestions about how to refactor their program. Our tutor generates this feedback from model solutions and properties that a solution should satisfy. This paper studies the feasibility of using model solutions together with the desired properties of solutions to analyse the work of a student. It describes an experiment in which we analyse almost 3500 log entries from students using Ask-Elle to solve functional programming exercises, to determine how many of these programs are diagnosed correctly based on model solutions and the desired properties of solutions. Ask-Elle manages to correctly diagnose 82.9\% of the student programs. A further analysis of the student programs and the diagnoses shows that adding some reasonable model solutions, properties of model solutions, and general program transformations would increase this percentage to 92.9\%.},

However, testing is not normally taught in specific courses at many universities, but rather as a peripheral activity to programming. In this paper, we report on three separate experiences at teaching an advanced testing technique, property-based testing, and a supporting tool, QuviQ Quick Check, to both undergraduate and master students.},

	abstract = {We discuss our experiences in which students of a programming course were asked to submit both an implementation as well as a test set. A portion of a student's grade was then devoted both to the validity of a student's program on others' test sets, as well as how that student's test set performed in uncovering flaws in others' programs. The advantages are many, as this introduces implicit principles of software testing together with a bit of fun competition. The major complication is that such an all-pairs execution of tests grows quadratically with the number of participants, necessitating a fully automated scoring system.},
